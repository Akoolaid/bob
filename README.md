an upload of the source folder of my discord bot, bob, which is online in two servers.

some command tutorials:

note:

use `!note <your note>` to set the note

use `!note access` to get the most recent note added


vbformation:

use `!vbformation <number of players in your team (2-6 players)>` to get the traditionally correct formation for your volleyball team

example: `!vbformation 4`
